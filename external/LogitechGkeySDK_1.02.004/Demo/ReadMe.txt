For demo to work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

For demo to work, you need to have the Logitech Gaming Software (LGS)
running, and set the device's G-keys to report G-keys rather than Macros.

Do the following:

- install and start latest LGS for your product from logitech.com website
(version 8.35 or newer)
- run demo program (this will have the effect of creating a profile in
LGS)
- when running LGS, select device for which you want to see
G-keys being pressed
- choose the view to customize buttons, or customize G-keys (on bottom
bar)
- make sure "DisplayGkeys" profile is selected in top bar
- drag "G-key" command from left bar onto device buttons
- switch back to demo program, and press the keys that have "G-key"
assigned to them.
