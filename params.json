{"name":"Nice Input Library","tagline":"Gaming input library for Windows.","body":"Nice Input Library\r\n==================\r\n\r\nNIL is a gaming input library for Windows, inspired by the Open Input System.\r\n\r\n### Platform\r\n\r\nSupported platforms are Windows Vista and newer. XP is not supported.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\nNIL is written in C++11, and by default builds as a statically linked x64 library under Visual Studio 2012.  \r\nNIL uses certain APIs from the Windows Driver Kit, so the WDK is required for compiling.\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\n\r\nNIL utilises three different input APIs to achieve best possible input from different types of devices:\r\n* [Raw Input API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms645543%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) for all mice & keyboard input, with zero lag and no special key weirdness\r\n* [XInput API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh405053%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) for XBOX 360 controller input\r\n* [DirectInput API](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee416842%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) for all other joysticks & gamepads\r\n\r\nNIL can tell apart every input device connected to the computer, including keyboards and mice.  \r\nMulti-keyboard and multi-mice input support is, for once, a breeze.\r\n\r\nNIL is fully based on Plug-and-Play support: It knows when devices are connected and disconnected  \r\nfrom the computer, and remembers previously-connected devices when reconnected.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, NIL is capable of receiving direct input from the [G-keys](https://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/21506) of certain Logitech Gaming keyboards & mice.\r\n\r\nNIL is single-threaded, buffered and fully listener-based.\r\n\r\n### Todo\r\n\r\n* Force feedback support.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNIL is licensed under the **MIT** license.  \r\nFor full license text, see the LICENSE file.\r\n\r\nLogitech SDKs under the *external* folder are property of Logitech.  \r\nSee the Logitech SDK documentation files for licensing specifics.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
